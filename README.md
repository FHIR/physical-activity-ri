# Physical Activity Reference Implementation (physical-activity-ri)

Welcome to the **Physical Activity Reference Implementation** repository.  
This project provides a full-stack reference implementation aligned with the [Physical Activity Implementation Guide](https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/physical-activity/). It includes:

- **Patient App** for individuals to track and manage their physical activity.
- **Provider App** for care providers to view, manage, and assign activity-related goals.
- **Docker-based server setup** using Keycloak and HAPI FHIR for identity and data management.
- **User documentation** to assist with setup and navigation of both apps.

## üßç‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Patient App

The Patient App helps users:

- Log and track their physical activity data
- Set personal goals
- Sync activity data with FHIR-based healthcare systems

## ü©∫ Provider App

The Provider App enables healthcare professionals to:

- Review patient-submitted activity data
- Prescribe and monitor physical activity goals
- Coordinate care based on shared, real-time data

## üõ†Ô∏è Server Setup

The `ServerSetup` folder includes a **Docker Compose** configuration that provisions:

- **Keycloak** ‚Äì for identity and access management
- **HAPI FHIR Server** ‚Äì for storing and exchanging FHIR resources

This environment allows both apps to securely interact with the FHIR server in accordance with the implementation guide.

Documentation for both apps can be found in the [`/Documentation`](./Documentation) folder.  
It includes user guides for setup, navigation, and general use of the Patient and Provider apps.
